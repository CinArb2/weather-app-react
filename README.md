- First, I inform the user that we will proceed to use their location.
- Once the user accepts to continue, the geolocation request is made.
- The user by means of the prompt has the right to allow or block. 
  * If the user allows access, a card with the weather info for his city will be displayed.
  * If the user blocks access, a message will be displayed telling them to please allow access from their browser settings.
